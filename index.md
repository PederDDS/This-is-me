## Hey! Welcome to Peder's GitHub

**So, who am I?**
A Norwegian exhange student spending the next few months at UCSD. Here are the goals for my stay: 
* Travel
* Meet new people
* Learn to surf

### Programming

But I also want to learn some new things, and I definitly want to improve my programming skills. So far I have programmed in these languages: 
1. C
2. C++
3. Go
4. Python
 
Always remember that:
>Deleted code is debugged code

And that: 

```
return 1; # returns 1

```
